## What is PLEOS ?
PLEOS is an Aster System's service made to simplify education, with a set of Open Source Software, mostly made to handle simulation, test, exercices... More information in the website : https://aster-system.github.io/aster-system/projects/pleos.html.

This repository contains all the needed things to handle PLEOS subjects.
