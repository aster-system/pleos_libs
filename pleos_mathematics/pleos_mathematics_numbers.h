// PLEOS, by Aster System, is a project which aims education.
// By using the power of SCLS and other Aster System's tools, we created  this.
// We want to make education easier for everyone (teachers, as students and pupils).
// The software is made in french, because the main goal is France educational system.
// For more information, see : https://aster-system.github.io/aster-system/projects/pleos.html.
